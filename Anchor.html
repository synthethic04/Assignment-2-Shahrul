        Apple Inc. is an American multinational technology company headquartered
        in Cupertino, California, that designs, develops and sells consumer
        electronics, computer software, and online services. It is considered
        one of the Big Tech technology companies, alongside Amazon, Google,
        Microsoft, and Facebook.[8][9][10] <br />

        The company's hardware products include the iPhone smartphone, the iPad
        tablet computer, the Mac personal computer, the iPod portable media
        player, the Apple Watch smartwatch, the Apple TV digital media player,
        the AirPods wireless earbuds and the HomePod smart speaker. Apple's
        software includes macOS, iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and tvOS operating
        systems, the iTunes media player, the Safari web browser, the Shazam
        music identifier and the iLife and iWork creativity and productivity
        suites, as well as professional applications like Final Cut Pro, Logic
        Pro, and Xcode. Its online services include the iTunes Store, the iOS
        App Store, Mac App Store, Apple Music, Apple TV+, iMessage, and iCloud.
        Other services include Apple Store, Genius Bar, AppleCare, Apple Pay,
        Apple Pay Cash, and Apple Card. <br />

        Apple was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne in
        April 1976 to develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer,
        though Wayne sold his share back within 12 days. It was incorporated as
        Apple Computer, Inc., in January 1977, and sales of its computers,
        including the Apple II, grew quickly. Within a few years, Jobs and
        Wozniak had hired a staff of computer designers and had a production
        line. Apple went public in 1980 to instant financial success. Over the
        next few years, Apple shipped new computers featuring innovative
        graphical user interfaces, such as the original Macintosh in 1984, and
        Apple's marketing advertisements for its products received widespread
        critical acclaim. However, the high price of its products and limited
        application library caused problems, as did power struggles between
        executives. In 1985, Wozniak departed Apple amicably and remained an
        honorary employee,[11] while Jobs and others resigned to found NeXT.[12]
        <br />

        As the market for personal computers expanded and evolved through the
        1990s, Apple lost market share to the lower-priced duopoly of Microsoft
        Windows on Intel PC clones. The board recruited CEO Gil Amelio to what
        would be a 500-day charge for him to rehabilitate the financially
        troubled company—reshaping it with layoffs, executive restructuring, and
        product focus. In 1997, he led Apple to buy NeXT, solving the
        desperately failed operating system strategy and bringing Jobs back.
        Jobs regained leadership status, becoming CEO in 2000. Apple swiftly
        returned to profitability under the revitalizing Think different
        campaign, as he rebuilt Apple's status by launching the iMac in 1998,
        opening the retail chain of Apple Stores in 2001, and acquiring numerous
        companies to broaden the software portfolio. In January 2007, Jobs
        renamed the company Apple Inc., reflecting its shifted focus toward
        consumer electronics, and launched the iPhone to great critical acclaim
        and financial success. In August 2011, Jobs resigned as CEO due to
        health complications, and Tim Cook became the new CEO. Two months later,
        Jobs died, marking the end of an era for the company. In June 2019, Jony
        Ive, Apple's CDO, left the company to start his own firm, but stated he
        would work with Apple as its primary client. <br />

        Apple's worldwide annual revenue totaled $274.5 billion for the 2020
        fiscal year. Apple is the world's largest technology company by revenue
        and one of the world's most valuable companies. It is also the world's
        third-largest mobile phone manufacturer after Samsung and Huawei.[13] In
        August 2018, Apple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to be
        valued at over $1 trillion[14][15] and just two years later in August
        2020 became the first $2 trillion U.S. company.[16][17] The company
        employs 137,000 full-time employees[18] and maintains 510 retail stores
        in 25 countries as of 2020.[19] It operates the iTunes Store, which is
        the world's largest music retailer. As of January 2020, more than 1.5
        billion Apple products are actively in use worldwide.[20] The company
        also has a high level of brand loyalty and is ranked as the world's most
        valuable brand. However, Apple receives significant criticism regarding
        the labor practices of its contractors, its environmental practices and
        unethical business practices, including anti-competitive behavior, as
        well as the origins of source materials.

        Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. (/ˈhwɑːˌweɪ/; Chinese: 华为; pinyin: About
        this soundHuáwéi) is a Chinese multinational technology company
        headquartered in Shenzhen, Guangdong. It designs, develops, and sells
        telecommunications equipment and consumer electronics (mainly
        smartphones).[4] <br />

        The company was founded in 1987 by Ren Zhengfei, a former Deputy
        Regimental Chief in the People's Liberation Army.[5] Initially focused
        on manufacturing phone switches, Huawei has expanded its business to
        include building telecommunications networks, providing operational and
        consulting services and equipment to enterprises inside and outside of
        China, and manufacturing communications devices for the consumer
        market.[6][7] Huawei has over 194,000 employees as of December 2019.[8]
        <br />

        Huawei has deployed its products and services in more than 170
        countries.[9] It overtook Ericsson in 2012 as the largest
        telecommunications equipment manufacturer in the world,[10] and overtook
        Apple in 2018 as the second-largest manufacturer of smartphones in the
        world, behind Samsung Electronics.[11] In December 2019, Huawei reported
        that its annual revenue had risen to $121.72 billion US dollars in
        2019.[12] <br />

        Although successful internationally, Huawei has faced difficulties in
        some markets, due to claims of undue state support, links to the
        People's Liberation Army, and cybersecurity concerns—primarily from the
        United States government—that Huawei's infrastructure equipment may
        enable surveillance by the Chinese government.[13][14] With the
        development of 5G wireless networks, there have been calls from the U.S.
        and its allies to not do any kind of business with Huawei or other
        Chinese telecommunications companies such as ZTE.[15] Huawei has argued
        that its products posed "no greater cybersecurity risk" than those of
        any other vendor and that there is no evidence of the U.S. espionage
        claims.[16] Questions regarding Huawei's ownership and control as well
        as concerns regarding the extent of state support also remain.[13]
        Huawei has also been accused of assisting in the surveillance and mass
        detention of Uyghurs in the Xinjiang re-education camps, which have
        resulted in sanctions by the United States Department of
        State.[17][18][19] <br />

        In the midst of an ongoing trade war between China and the United
        States, Huawei was restricted from doing commerce with U.S. companies
        due to alleged previous willful violations of U.S. sanctions against
        Iran. On 29 June 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump reached an agreement
        to resume trade talks with China and announced that he would ease the
        aforementioned sanctions on Huawei. Huawei cut 600 jobs at its Santa
        Clara research center in June, and in December 2019 founder Ren Zhengfei
        said it was moving the center to Canada because the restrictions would
        block them from interacting with US employees.[20][21] <br />

        In July 2020, Huawei surpassed Samsung and Apple to become the leading
        smartphone mobile brand in the world for the first time primarily due to
        a drop in Samsung's global sales in the second quarter of 2020 owing to
        the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.[22][23][24]

        The Samsung Group[3] is a South Korean multinational conglomerate
        headquartered in Samsung Town, Seoul.[1] It comprises numerous
        affiliated businesses,[1] most of them united under the Samsung brand,
        and is the largest South Korean chaebol (business conglomerate). <br />

        Samsung was founded by Lee Byung-chul in 1938 as a trading company. Over
        the next three decades, the group diversified into areas including food
        processing, textiles, insurance, securities, and retail. Samsung entered
        the electronics industry in the late 1960s and the construction and
        shipbuilding industries in the mid-1970s; these areas would drive its
        subsequent growth. Following Lee's death in 1987, Samsung was separated
        into four business groups – Samsung Group, Shinsegae Group, CJ Group and
        Hansol Group. Since 1990, Samsung has increasingly globalised its
        activities and electronics; in particular, its mobile phones and
        semiconductors have become its most important source of income. As of
        2020, Samsung has the 8th highest global brand value.[4] <br />

        Notable Samsung industrial affiliates include Samsung Electronics (the
        world's largest information technology company, consumer electronics
        maker and chipmaker measured by 2017 revenues),[5][6] Samsung Heavy
        Industries (the world's 2nd largest shipbuilder measured by 2010
        revenues),[7] and Samsung Engineering and Samsung C&T (respectively the
        world's 13th and 36th largest construction companies).[8] Other notable
        subsidiaries include Samsung Life Insurance (the world's 14th largest
        life insurance company),[9] Samsung Everland (operator of Everland
        Resort, the oldest theme park in South Korea)[10] and Cheil Worldwide
        (the world's 15th largest advertising agency, as measured by 2012
        revenues).[11][12] <br />

        Samsung has a powerful influence on South Korea's economic development,
        politics, media and culture and has been a major driving force behind
        the "Miracle on the Han River".[13][14] Its affiliate companies produce
        around a fifth of South Korea's total exports.[15] Samsung's revenue was
        equal to 17% of South Korea's $1,082 billion GDP.[16]

        Sony Corporation (ソニー株式会社, Sonī kabushiki gaisha, /ˈsoʊni/
        SOH-nee, commonly known as Sony and stylized as SONY) is a Japanese
        multinational conglomerate corporation headquartered in Kōnan, Minato,
        Tokyo.[7][1] The company operates as one of the world's largest
        manufacturers of consumer and professional electronic products, the
        largest video game console company, the second largest video game
        publisher, the second largest record company, as well as one of the most
        comprehensive media companies,[8][9] being the largest Japanese media
        conglomerate by size overtaking the privately held, family-owned Yomiuri
        Shimbun Holdings, the largest Japanese media conglomerate by revenue.
        <br />

        Sony, with its 50 percent market share in the image sensor market, is
        among the semiconductor sales leaders[10][11] and, as of 2015, the
        fifth-largest television manufacturer in the world by annual sales
        figures. It is the world's largest player in the premium TV market, a
        market for a television of at least 55 inches with a price higher than
        $2,500.[12][13] <br />

        Sony Corporation is the holding company of the Sony Group
        (ソニー・グループ, Sonī Gurūpu), which comprises Sony Electronics, Sony
        Semiconductor Solutions, Sony Pictures, Sony Music, Sony Interactive
        Entertainment, Sony Financial Holdings, and others. <br />

        The company's slogan is Be Moved. Their former slogans were The One and
        Only (1979–1982), It's a Sony (1982–2005), like.no.other (2005–2009)[14]
        and make.believe (2009–2013).[15] <br />

        Sony has a weak tie to the Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMFG)
        corporate group, the successor to the Mitsui group.[16] Sony is listed
        on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (in which it is a constituent of the Nikkei
        225 and TOPIX Core30 indexes) with an additional listing in the form of
        American depositary receipts listed in the New York Stock Exchange
        (traded since 1970, making it the oldest Japanese company to be listed
        in an American exchange), and was ranked 122nd on the 2020 Fortune
        Global 500 list.[17]
